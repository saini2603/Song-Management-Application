/*I(Rohit Saini) faced some difficulties while completing this project.we took first 2 classes Song and SongLoader of mine assignment-2;we found it the best versions of our assignment.
I got difficulty in moving the data from one index to another because firstly I move the contents in the list,  then i  deleted the contents of previous file then placed the contents from list to file after performing operation.The sort operation was easy. The most difficult part was in this ,was Hashmap because we did not practise on it.and was difficult to pass the arguments in the hashmap list.
i did my best what i learned in it.Dontknow  it is perfect or not. Want some feedback from you sir.I want some suggestions from you.
I was feeling problem in create a parametrized constructor without id variable and got the next id from the latest hishest id +1.So I assigned comparator,it is the innovative part for me.
Hope you like this project you find it well. We worked smoothly in this project.Thank you....
